  "Testimonials.codyReferral": "\"I worked with Sebastien at LandTrust for over a year, and it was incredible to see how quickly he picked up speed and started pushing code that solved customer pain points. Sebastien not only knocked out our entire backlog of to-dos in under two months but then asked for more and was always ready to work outside his comfort zone. He is extremely detail oriented and required very little guidance on every project we worked on together. He was attentive in every meeting where I outlined design specs and actively asked questions, ensuring the highest quality output of the proposed solution. I enjoyed getting to know Sebastien virtually and in the company on-site at HQ in Montana! If you are looking for an engineer with an extreme work ethic and a self-driven approach, Sebastien is your guy! I highly recommend him for every team.\"",

  "Testimonials.joshReferral": "\"There are so many great things to say about Sebastien that it's hard to know where to begin. I've had the pleasure of mentoring Sebastien over the past year at Landtrust. He joined as a Junior Engineer with little real-world engineering experience but the right attitude. Sebastien took every day as an opportunity to learn something new and perfect what he already knew. He was always the first to volunteer for any task and gave his best effort to maximize his potential. By the end of his first year, Sebastien had gained more experience pushing code and providing solutions for both front-end and back-end than most Junior Engineers acquire in 3-5 years. Sebastien's attitude, work ethic, and drive make him a huge asset, and he's only getting started. I fully recommend Sebastien to anyone looking to elevate their efforts. He brings not just real-world experience, but also the fire and passion needed to excel in any role. Do yourself a favor and hire Sebastien quickly before another company gains this tremendous asset.\"",
